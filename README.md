# Learn Python 🐍

This repository contains my personal collection of Python exercises, notes, and mini-projects  
as I progress through learning Python as a Computer Engineering student.

## 📌 Purpose

To build a solid understanding of Python by practicing small tasks and creating simple, useful tools.  
Each folder represents a different stage of learning, from the basics to more structured problem-solving.

## 🧠 Learning Mindset

> "Learning by building. Every line of code brings me closer to mastery."
